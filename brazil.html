<p>Nestled amidst the lush tropical beauty of Brazil, this hotel offers a perfect blend of luxury, comfort, and the enchanting allure of the country's vibrant culture.Brazilians have an obsession with cleanliness. They wash their hands numerous times throughout the day, keep their homes sparkling clean and brush their teeth about ten times a day. Most Brazilians also shower at least twice a day. And during the hot, humid summers, many shower up to five times a day.
